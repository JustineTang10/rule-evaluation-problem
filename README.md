# Rule Evaluation Problem Implementation

This repository stores all the code for the implementation of the rule evaluation problem, including the standard brute force, greedy, and linear programming algorithms, as well as the custom disjunction algorithm as detailed in the paper. The disjunction algorithm can be found in the script `get_data.py`, while the other algorithms can be found in their respective scripts.

To run the experiments, run `gather_data.py` (for small test cases with values from 1-10, also running the brute force algorithm) or `gather_data_large.py` (for larger test cases with values from 1-100).
